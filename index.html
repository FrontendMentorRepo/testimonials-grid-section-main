        I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned <br> were current, if not more so, 
        in the company I joined. I <br> honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

        “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a <br>
        transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
        for <br> the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
        The next 12 <br> weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
        the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

        “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve <br>
        never written a line of code. I needed <br>
        some structure from professionals <br> who can help me learn programming <br>
         step by step. I was encouraged to<br>
          enroll by a former 
      student of theirs<br>
       who can only say wonderful things<br> about the program. The entire<br> curriculum and staff 
      did not <br>disappoint. They were very hands-on <br>and I never had to wait long for<br> assistance. The agile team 
      project, in <br>particular, was outstanding. It took <br>my learning to the next level in a way <br>that no tutorial 
      could ever have. In<br> fact, I’ve often referred to it during<br> interviews as an example of my<br> developent 
      experience. It certainly<br> helped me land a job as a full-stack <br>developer after receiving multiple <br>offers. 
      100% recommend! ”
